## React Markdown Editor

Simple project for markdown editing.

_(This README was made using the editor.)_

Live [preview](https://udayanshevade.github.io/react-markdown-editor/).

Made for [this prompt](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer).

The markdown conversion happens via web worker.

### Known issues:

- If the preview gets stuck in the "Loading preview" phase, try loading the editor in incognito. I had a clash with an extension. Need to resolve that.
